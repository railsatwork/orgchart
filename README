= Rendering an Org Chart live from a Rails 3 app 

This is an example of how to render an org chart using Graphviz and Rails 3.

Once you clone this repository, install graphviz, create a database, run the migrations, and run the rake task to seed the data.
After that you can start the server and the home page will take you to a dialog to select departments to render the org chart for.
  
  sudo port install graphviz
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate
  rake app:seed_data

  rails server

Enjoy!
